    def start_link(_opts) do
      Broadway.start_link(__MODULE__,
        name: __MODULE__,
        producer: [
          module: {BroadwayKafka.Producer, [
            hosts: [localhost: 9092],
            group_id: "group_1",
            topics: ["test"],
          ]},
          concurrency: 1
        ],
        processors: [
          default: [
            concurrency: 10
          ]
        ]
      )
    end
